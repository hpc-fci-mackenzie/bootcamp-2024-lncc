The code implements a Jacobi iterative method that solves the Laplace equation for heat
transfer. The Jacobi iterative method is a means for iteratively calculating the solution to a
differential equation by continuously refining the solution until the answer has converged
upon a stable solution or some fixed number of steps have completed and the answer is
either deemed good enough or unconverged. The example code represents a 2D plane
of material that has been divided into a grid of equally sized cells. As heat is applied
to the center of this plane, the Laplace equation dictates how the heat will transfer from
grid point to grid point over time. To calculate the temperature of a given grid point
for the next time iteration, one simply calculates the average of the temperatures of the
neighboring grid points from the current iteration. Once the next value for each grid point
is calculated, those values become the current temperature and the calculation continues.
At each step the maximum temperature change across all grid points will determine if the
problem has converged upon a steady state.
